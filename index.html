                <h3 class="card--heading">Recognising Anxiety</h3>
                <p>
                  Anxiety can feel like a constant state of worry, even about
                  everyday things. It might show up as a racing heart, trouble
                  concentrating, or feeling restless. You may notice physical
                  symptoms like sweating, tense muscles, or a feeling of dread.
                  It's okay to feel worried sometimes, but if these feelings
                  persist, it might be time to explore some helpful strategies.
                </p>
                <ul class="card--list">
                  <li class="card--list-item">
                    <strong>Practice Deep Breathing:</strong><br />
                    When you feel anxious, try deep breathing exercises. Breathe
                    in slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and breathe out
                    for 4 counts. This can help calm your mind and body.

                  <li class="card--list-item">
                    <strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong><br />
                    Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to ground yourself. Focus on 5
                    things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can
                    hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It
                    helps bring you back to the present moment.

                  <li class="card--list-item">
                    <strong>Limit Caffeine and Sugar:</strong><br />
                    Stimulants like caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety.
                    Try swapping coffee for herbal tea or a glass of water,
                    especially when you’re feeling on edge.
                  </li>
                  <li class="card--list-item">
                    <strong>Set a Worry Time:</strong><br />
                    Give yourself permission to worry—but set a time for it. For
                    example, allow yourself 15 minutes each day to jot down
                    worries, then put them away. This helps prevent them from
                    taking over your whole day.

              <h3 class="card--heading">Understanding Depression</h3>
              <p>
                Depression goes beyond feeling sad—it's a persistent sense of
                hopelessness that can drain your energy and make it hard to
                enjoy things you once loved. Signs include losing interest in
                activities, changes in sleep patterns, and feeling tired all the
                time. It’s normal to feel down occasionally, but if these
                feelings last for weeks, you’re not alone, and help is
                available.
              </p>

              <ul class="card--list">
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Break Tasks Into Small Steps:</strong><br />
                  Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Start
                  with something small, like making your bed or taking a shower.
                  These small wins can help build momentum.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Reach Out to Someone You Trust:</strong><br />
                  Isolation can make depression feel heavier. Try reaching out
                  to a friend or family member, even if it's just for a short
                  chat. Connection can make a big difference.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Engage in Physical Activity:</strong><br />
                  Physical activity, even a short walk around the block, can
                  help release endorphins that improve mood. Start with 5-10
                  minutes a day and build from there.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong><br />
                  Remind yourself that it’s okay to not be okay. Being kind to
                  yourself and recognizing that it’s not your fault can be a
                  small but significant way to ease the burden.

              <h3 class="card--heading">Spotting Burnout</h3>
              <p>
                Burnout often comes from feeling overwhelmed at work, school, or
                even in daily life. It might look like feeling constantly
                exhausted, becoming irritable, or struggling to focus. You may
                feel detached from what used to matter to you, or like you're
                running on empty. Recognizing these signs is the first step to
                taking a well-deserved break and recharging.
              </p>
              <ul class="card--list">
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Set Clear Boundaries:</strong><br />
                  It’s okay to say “no” when you need to. Setting boundaries at
                  work or in personal life can help protect your time and
                  energy. Practice saying no without feeling guilty—your
                  well-being comes first.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong><br />
                  Use the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a
                  5-minute break. This can keep you from feeling overwhelmed and
                  give your mind a chance to rest.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Reconnect with Activities You Enjoy:</strong><br />
                  Burnout often makes us lose sight of what we love. Try to
                  reintroduce hobbies, even if just for 10 minutes a day. It can
                  help bring back a sense of enjoyment and purpose.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong><br />
                  Rest is essential for recovery. Establish a wind-down routine
                  before bed—like reading or listening to calming music—to
                  improve your sleep quality and recharge for the next day.

              <h3 class="card--heading">Signs of Chronic Stress</h3>
              <p>
                Stress is a normal part of life, but when it becomes chronic, it
                can impact your body and mind in lasting ways. Symptoms might
                include headaches, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, or
                feeling overwhelmed by everyday tasks. Recognizing when stress
                has become a constant companion can help you take steps toward
                managing it more effectively.
              </p>
              <ul class="card--list">
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong><br />
                  Mindfulness exercises, like focusing on your breath or
                  listening to a guided meditation, can help reduce the impact
                  of stress. Even just a few minutes can make a difference.

                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Organize and Prioritize Tasks:</strong><br />
                  When you’re stressed, even small tasks can feel daunting. Try
                  writing down a list and tackling one task at a time. Start
                  with the most important, and don’t be afraid to break bigger
                  tasks into smaller steps.

                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Spend Time in Nature:</strong><br />
                  Being outside, whether it’s in a park, garden, or even on a
                  balcony, can help reduce stress levels. Take a moment to
                  notice the sights, sounds, and smells around you—it’s a simple
                  way to refresh your mind.

                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Limit Exposure to Stress Triggers:</strong><br />
                  If possible, identify what triggers your stress and try to
                  minimize exposure to it. For example, if news or social media
                  overwhelm you, consider taking a break or limiting your time
                  on those platforms.

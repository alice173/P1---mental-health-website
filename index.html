              <h3 class="card--heading">Recognising Anxiety</h3>
              <p>
                Anxiety can feel like a constant state of worry, even about
                everyday things. It might show up as a racing heart, trouble
                concentrating, or feeling restless. You may notice physical
                symptoms like sweating, tense muscles, or a feeling of dread.
                It's okay to feel worried sometimes, but if these feelings
                persist, it might be time to explore some helpful strategies.
              </p>
              <ul class="card--list">
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Practice Deep Breathing:</strong><br />
                  When you feel anxious, try deep breathing exercises. Breathe
                  in slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and breathe out
                  for 4 counts. This can help calm your mind and body.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong><br />
                  Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to ground yourself. Focus on 5
                  things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can
                  hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It
                  helps bring you back to the present moment.

                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Limit Caffeine and Sugar:</strong><br />
                  Stimulants like caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety.
                  Try swapping coffee for herbal tea or a glass of water,
                  especially when you’re feeling on edge.
                </li>
                <li class="card--list-item">
                  <strong>Set a Worry Time:</strong><br />
                  Give yourself permission to worry—but set a time for it. For
                  example, allow yourself 15 minutes each day to jot down
                  worries, then put them away. This helps prevent them from
                  taking over your whole day.

            <h3 class="card--heading">Understanding Depression</h3>
            <p>
              Depression goes beyond feeling sad—it's a persistent sense of
              hopelessness that can drain your energy and make it hard to
              enjoy things you once loved. Signs include losing interest in
              activities, changes in sleep patterns, and feeling tired all the
              time. It’s normal to feel down occasionally, but if these
              feelings last for weeks, you’re not alone, and help is
              available.
            </p>

            <ul class="card--list">
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Break Tasks Into Small Steps:</strong><br />
                Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Start
                with something small, like making your bed or taking a shower.
                These small wins can help build momentum.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Reach Out to Someone You Trust:</strong><br />
                Isolation can make depression feel heavier. Try reaching out
                to a friend or family member, even if it's just for a short
                chat. Connection can make a big difference.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Engage in Physical Activity:</strong><br />
                Physical activity, even a short walk around the block, can
                help release endorphins that improve mood. Start with 5-10
                minutes a day and build from there.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong><br />
                Remind yourself that it’s okay to not be okay. Being kind to
                yourself and recognizing that it’s not your fault can be a
                small but significant way to ease the burden.

            <h3 class="card--heading">Spotting Burnout</h3>
            <p>
              Burnout often comes from feeling overwhelmed at work, school, or
              even in daily life. It might look like feeling constantly
              exhausted, becoming irritable, or struggling to focus. You may
              feel detached from what used to matter to you, or like you're
              running on empty. Recognizing these signs is the first step to
              taking a well-deserved break and recharging.
            </p>
            <ul class="card--list">
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Set Clear Boundaries:</strong><br />
                It’s okay to say “no” when you need to. Setting boundaries at
                work or in personal life can help protect your time and
                energy. Practice saying no without feeling guilty—your
                well-being comes first.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong><br />
                Use the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a
                5-minute break. This can keep you from feeling overwhelmed and
                give your mind a chance to rest.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Reconnect with Activities You Enjoy:</strong><br />
                Burnout often makes us lose sight of what we love. Try to
                reintroduce hobbies, even if just for 10 minutes a day. It can
                help bring back a sense of enjoyment and purpose.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong><br />
                Rest is essential for recovery. Establish a wind-down routine
                before bed—like reading or listening to calming music—to
                improve your sleep quality and recharge for the next day.

            <h3 class="card--heading">Signs of Chronic Stress</h3>
            <p>
              Stress is a normal part of life, but when it becomes chronic, it
              can impact your body and mind in lasting ways. Symptoms might
              include headaches, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, or
              feeling overwhelmed by everyday tasks. Recognizing when stress
              has become a constant companion can help you take steps toward
              managing it more effectively.
            </p>
            <ul class="card--list">
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong><br />
                Mindfulness exercises, like focusing on your breath or
                listening to a guided meditation, can help reduce the impact
                of stress. Even just a few minutes can make a difference.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Organize and Prioritize Tasks:</strong><br />
                When you’re stressed, even small tasks can feel daunting. Try
                writing down a list and tackling one task at a time. Start
                with the most important, and don’t be afraid to break bigger
                tasks into smaller steps.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Spend Time in Nature:</strong><br />
                Being outside, whether it’s in a park, garden, or even on a
                balcony, can help reduce stress levels. Take a moment to
                notice the sights, sounds, and smells around you—it’s a simple
                way to refresh your mind.
              </li>
              <li class="card--list-item">
                <strong>Limit Exposure to Stress Triggers:</strong><br />
                If possible, identify what triggers your stress and try to
                minimize exposure to it. For example, if news or social media
                overwhelm you, consider taking a break or limiting your time
                on those platforms.
